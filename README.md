**Lettuce Growth Analysis**

This project investigates how environmental factors **(temperature, humidity, TDS value, pH level)** and **growth days** influence lettuce growth. Using historical data, it aims to identify patterns and correlations to support more effective cultivation strategies.

**-** **Tools:** Excel

**- Dataset (Kaggle):** [Lettuce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jurijsruko/lettuce/data?select=lettuce_dataset.csv)

**Research Questions**

1. What is the relationship between humidity and temperature?
2. Does increasing total dissolved solids shorten the time to maturity?
3. Can lettuce growth be predicted based on environmental conditions?
4. What is the dataset’s time range, and how can it inform next season’s planning?

**Dataset Overview**

**- Plant_ID:** Unique identifier for each plant

**- Date:** Observation timestamp

**- Temperature (°C):** Recorded air temperature

**- Humidity (%):** Environmental humidity level

**- TDS (ppm):** Total dissolved solids (nutrient availability)

**- pH Level:** Environmental pH

**- Growth Days:** Time from planting to maturity

**Key Insights**

Humidity and temperature are almost independent (R² ≈ 0).

Correlation between total dissolved solids and growth days is negative: -0.0206. Slope is pretty small: -0.0023. As a result,  total dissolved solids hardly affect growth time.

Weak correlations between environmental factors and lettuce growth days:

- Temperature: -0.0745
- Humidity: -0.0145
- TDS: -0.0206
- pH: 0.003

Growth duration: 1–48 days (avg. ~23 days) from 03/08/2023 to 17/09/2023.

Historical data show that lettuce growth is influenced by multiple factors beyond just environmental conditions.
