I am currently pursuing the Google Data Analytics course and working on Project 1, titled “Lettuce Growth Days.”

Questions to guide data analysis process:
1. Is there any a connection between humidity and temperature?
2. If total dissolved solids are increased when growing lettuce, will it shorten the time needed for the plants to reach maturity?
3. Based on the dataset, how can prediction about growth be made given the condition?
4. What is the data range for this dataset? Do we need an understanding of this data for next season?

Key facets of the lettuce database: 
Plant Identifier (Plant_ID): A distinctive identifier assigned to each individual plant.
Date: The timestamp of the observation, marking key milestones in the growth process.
Temperature (°C): The recorded temperature in degrees Celsius, a pivotal environmental variable.
Humidity (%): The percentage representing the humidity level, influencing the plant’s water uptake.
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) Value (ppm): A measurement of dissolved solids in parts per million,
reflecting nutrient availability.
pH Level: The environmental pH level, a crucial factor impacting nutrient absorption.
Growth Days: The duration, in days, from the initial growth stage to the plant’s full maturity
